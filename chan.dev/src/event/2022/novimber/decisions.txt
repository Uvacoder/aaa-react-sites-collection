# Project decisions

## url
- `event/2022/novimber`
- short url `/novimber`

## plural or not
I had naturally decided to use `event/` (singular) but but looks like i have `/talks` (plural) already.
I'm gonna go with singular but it kinda sucks.

## Dynamic of static
I'm feeling the tension to "set this up write."
Right now that means something like having a big bucket of `vim`-marked cnotent that I then collect into this event.
However, that's assuming a lot of things.
So I'm going to start with a very 1:1 file:page setup.
This will mean that I have to create relationships between next/prev content manually.
But that's fine, given how predictable the urls will be.
